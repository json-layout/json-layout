TODO:
  - traverse json schema
  - create a normalized layout keyword for each level based on schema and optional layout annotation
  - validate the normalized layout (json schema + custom assertion like the fact the the children keys match reality)
  - compile all partial schemas necessary for the stateful layout
  - optionally suggest serializing the result to js (serialization could also include types compiled from the schema)
